# rspec.vim

This is a lightweight RSpec runner for Vim and MacVim.

## Installation

Recommended installation with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```vim
Plugin 'thoughtbot/vim-rspec'
```

If using zsh on OS X it may be necessary to move `/etc/zshenv` to `/etc/zshrc`.

## Configuration

### Key mappings

Add your preferred key mappings to your `.vimrc` file.

```vim
" RSpec.vim mappings
map <Leader>t :call RunCurrentSpecFile()<CR>
map <Leader>e :call RunExamples()<CR>         " runs examples under cursor or in visual selection
map <Leader>l :call RunLastSpec()<CR>
map <Leader>a :call RunAllSpecs()<CR>
```

### Custom command

Overwrite the `g:rspec_command` variable to execute a custom command.

Example:

```vim
let g:rspec_command = "!rspec --drb {spec}"
```

This `g:rspec_command` variable can be used to support any number of test
runners or pre-loaders. For example, to use
[Dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch):

```vim
let g:rspec_command = "Dispatch rspec {spec}"
```
Or, [Dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) and
[Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) together:

```vim
let g:rspec_command = "compiler rspec | set makeprg=zeus | Make rspec {spec}"
```

### Custom runners

Overwrite the `g:rspec_runner` variable to set a custom launch script. At the
moment there are two MacVim-specific runners, i.e. `os_x_terminal` and
`os_x_iterm`. The default is `os_x_terminal`, but you can set this to anything
you want, provided you include the appropriate script inside the plugin's
`bin/` directory.

#### iTerm instead of Terminal

If you use iTerm, you can set `g:rspec_runner` to use the included iterm
launching script. This will run the specs in the last session of the current
terminal.

```vim
let g:rspec_runner = "os_x_iterm"
```

If you use the iTerm2 nightlies, the `os_x_iterm` runner will not work
(due to AppleScript incompatibilities between the old and new versions of iTerm2).

Instead use the `os_x_iterm2` runner, configure it like so:

```vim
let g:rspec_runner = "os_x_iterm2"
```

## Running tests

Tests are written using [`vim-vspec`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec)
and run with [`vim-flavor`](https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor).

Install the `vim-flavor` gem, install the dependencies and run the tests:

```
gem install vim-flavor
vim-flavor install
rake
```
