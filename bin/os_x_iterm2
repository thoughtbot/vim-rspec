# PLEASE NOTE: This launcher is for use with the upcoming release of
# iTerm2. Available currently as the nightly build downloads from
# http://iterm2.com/nightly/latest
#
# On the trivial side, the Application name changes from iTerm to
# iTerm2.  However, notably the AppleScript API used by iTerm2 has a
# several breaking changes, and existing iTerm AppleScripts will not
# work.

# If you would like to get documentation for the new iTerm2 /
# AppleScript API.  Open the AppleScript Editor on OSX, get the
# Library window (Cmd Shift L) Click the (+) button and select iTerm2
# from the /Applications folder.

# PLEASE NOTE: the download nightlies at the time of writing use
# filename iTerm.app, we recommend you rename it to iTerm2.app for
# convenience (this is so it matches the bundle app/id name.)
